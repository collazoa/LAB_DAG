## Contributers: Anja Collazo, Jess Rohmann, Marco Piccinini, Tobias Kurth, Georg Kuhn 

The LAB-DAG projects seeks to introduce the concept of directed acyclic graphs to biomedical laboratory (animal) research. We explore scenarios such as confounder bias, collider bias & measurement bias.

1) Introduce basic DAG vocabulary as a primer for laboratory/animal sciences 
2) Simulate DAG data (collider)
